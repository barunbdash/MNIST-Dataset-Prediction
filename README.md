# MNIST-Dataset-Prediction
The MNIST (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology) dataset is one of the most famous datasets in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It consists of handwritten digit images (0-9) and is widely used for training image processing systems.

Key Features of the MNIST Dataset -Total Images: 70,000 (60,000 training + 10,000 testing) -Image Size: 28x28 pixels (grayscale) -Number of Classes: 10 (digits 0-9) -Color Channel: Single-channel (black & white) -Format: Available in different formats such as .csv, .png, or as TensorFlow/Keras datasets.

🚀 Features
Preprocessing & Normalization: Standardizes images for better training.
CNN Model: Uses convolutional layers, max pooling, and dense layers.
Evaluation & Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in classifying digits.
Visualization: Plots training loss, accuracy, and sample predictions.
